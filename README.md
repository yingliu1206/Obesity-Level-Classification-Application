# Obesity-Level-Classification-Application

**Introduction:**

* Obesity has become a severe social issue. Being overweight may lead to serious health consequences such as cardiovascular disease

* In this case, in order to prevent bad health consequences from the beginning, it is essential to track the eating habits and physical condition of individuals and then predict their obesity levels based on those factors.

* We are using classification as an evaluation method since the goal is to estimate obesity levels and to study which factor/feature would contribute to the obesity level.

* We are commissioned to build a machine learning application that hospitals can use for predicting patientsâ€™ obesity levels to maximum productivity.
